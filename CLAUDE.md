# Tavi (Hackathon Build)

AI-native managed marketplace for blue-collar trades. Facility managers submit work orders; the system discovers vendors, runs a multi-modal agentic auction, and dispatches the winning quote.

One repo, one project, three subparts — each developed in its own Claude Code session for context isolation. Everything lives together in this directory.

1. **Intake** (`backend/` + `frontend/`) — chat → structured work order. Done: chat intake, Google Places autocomplete for service address, SQLite persistence. On confirm, intake automatically kicks off subpart 2 as a background task.
2. **Vendor discovery** (`backend/app/services/discovery/` + `backend/app/routers/discovery.py`) — work order → ranked nearby vendors. Done: live Google Places (new API) nearby search, BBB profile scrape, cumulative + urgency-aware subjective scoring, hard filters (distance / hours / quality threshold), `/discovery/run` endpoint, admin DB explorer. `vendor-discovery/` (top-level dir) holds archival fixture data from an earlier spike — not load-bearing.
3. **Vendor contact / auctioning** — agentic outreach + engagement state machine + command center. Schema placeholders (`Negotiation.messages`, `actions_log`, `status` keyed to `EngagementStatus`) are already in the DB. Outreach / UI not yet started.

## Hackathon context

- ~48-hour build, 60-min mid-build co-work + end-of-build demo
- Evaluated on: technical aptitude, hustle, taste
- Subpart 3 (vendor contact / auctioning) is where most engineering time should land per the rubric
- Submission: repo link + setup/run instructions + exported prompt history

## Stack

- Backend: FastAPI (Python, `uv` for deps)
- Frontend: Next.js 16 / React 19 / TypeScript / Tailwind v4
- DB: SQLite via SQLAlchemy (swap-ready to Postgres; their internal stack is Postgres)
- LLM: Anthropic Claude via `anthropic` SDK (model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` by default)
- External APIs:
  - **Google Places API (new)** — address autocomplete (intake) + nearby/text search + place details (discovery). Requires `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`.
  - **BBB (bbb.org)** — scraped via `httpx` + `beautifulsoup4` for grade, accreditation, complaint counts, years-in-business.
- Deferred: Twilio, Resend, voice providers

## Architecture (shared across subparts)

Three layers, same pattern across all three subparts:

1. **Frontend** — Next.js + React + TypeScript. Subpart-specific UIs share one app: `frontend/app/page.tsx` is the intake chat + address picker; `frontend/app/admin/page.tsx` is a read-only DB explorer used to inspect discovery output end-to-end. Hosted privately (hackathon v0: localhost dev / unlisted deploy). Communicates with the backend over HTTPS / JSON (REST).

2. **Backend** — FastAPI (Python). The only process that touches the DB and external APIs. Router layout under `backend/app/routers/`:
   - `/intake/*` — chat turn, start, confirm (intake.py)
   - `/intake/places/*` — Google Places autocomplete proxy (places.py)
   - `/discovery/*` — vendor discovery runs (discovery.py)
   - `/admin/*` — read-only DB views for the admin explorer (admin.py)
   - `/health` — liveness

3. **Data & external services** (reached only through the backend):
   - **SQLite** via SQLAlchemy — primary store (file: `backend/tavi.db`)
   - **Anthropic Claude** — field extraction + reply drafting (intake); will drive outreach drafting + vendor persona simulation in subpart 3
   - **Google Places API (new)** — autocomplete + place details (intake); nearby/text search + place details (discovery)
   - **BBB scrape** — enriches each vendor with grade / accreditation / complaint resolution / tenure for scoring

Key principle: the frontend never talks directly to external APIs or the DB. All third-party credentials and DB access live in the backend.

## Subpart 1 — Intake (`backend/` + `frontend/app/page.tsx`)

Captures a facility manager's service request and persists it as a structured work order. Backend code lives in `backend/app/routers/intake.py`, `backend/app/routers/places.py`, and `backend/app/services/intake.py`; the LLM plumbing is in `backend/app/agent.py` + `backend/app/prompts.py` + `backend/app/tools.py`.

### Data model (`work_orders` table)

- `id`, `created_at`, `created_by`
- `trade` — enum: plumbing, hvac, electrical, lawncare, handyman, appliance_repair
- `description` — free text
- `address_line`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `lat`, `lng` — **required**, populated by the frontend's Google Places autocomplete widget (not by the LLM)
- `access_notes` — nullable free text
- `urgency` — enum: emergency, urgent, scheduled, flexible
- `scheduled_for` — datetime (UTC)
- `budget_cap_cents` — int
- `quality_threshold` — float; required at collection time (LLM always confirms a value, defaults to 4.0 when the user waffles)
- `requires_licensed`, `requires_insured` — bools

### Data flow

- **Chat turn**: user types → `POST /intake/chat` → FastAPI runs a Claude tool-use loop that may call `update_fields` → returns the updated `WorkOrderPartial` + reply + `is_ready` + `missing` list. LLM does NOT set address fields directly; if it notices an address in chat it can set `address_hint` (transient, non-persisted) to seed the UI's autocomplete input.
- **Address picker**: user types in the autocomplete input → `POST /intake/places/autocomplete` → backend hits Google Places → suggestions back. User clicks one → `POST /intake/places/select` → backend hits Places `:getPlace` → structured `{address_line, city, state, zip, lat, lng, formatted_address}` back. The frontend patches these into `fields` locally; they ride along in the next `/intake/chat` or `/intake/confirm` request.
- **Confirm**: once all required fields are non-null and the user affirms, `POST /intake/confirm` persists the `work_orders` row and **spawns a background task that calls `run_discovery`** (subpart 2). The confirm response returns immediately with the work-order ID; discovery completes asynchronously.

### Scope

**In:** chat intake (LLM extracts → user confirms → persists), Google Places autocomplete, automatic hand-off to subpart 2.
**Out:** voice intake, auth / multi-tenancy / payments — those remain deferred.

### Conventions (subpart 1)

- No draft persistence: chat state is ephemeral, only confirmed orders hit the DB
- Address fields are NOT set by the LLM — only by the UI's Places picker
- User profile is intentionally blank in v0 (no saved defaults); every conversation starts fresh

## Subpart 2 — Vendor discovery (`backend/app/services/discovery/`)

Given a submitted work order, discover candidate vendors within ~20 miles using live Google Places, enrich with a BBB scrape, compute objective + urgency-aware subjective scores, apply hard filters, rank, and persist. The result is inspectable via the admin DB explorer.

### Inputs / outputs

- **Input**: a `work_order` row produced by subpart 1 (must have `lat`/`lng`).
- **Output**: a `DiscoveryRun` row + a `Negotiation` row per candidate vendor, plus cached `Vendor` rows. `DiscoveryRunResponse` schema bundles these into `ranked` + `filtered` lists.

### Data sources (live, not fixtures)

- **Google Places API (new)** via `places_client.py` — `searchNearby` for plumbing/electrical (those have first-class type tags), `searchText` for hvac/handyman/lawncare/appliance_repair (the new API rejects e.g. `hvac_contractor` outright). Trade → strategy mapping in `trade_map.py`. Uses IDs-only masks for search (free tier) and an Enterprise field mask for details.
- **BBB scrape** via `bbb_client.py` — `httpx` + `beautifulsoup4`, rate-limited by `BBB_REQUEST_DELAY_S`. Best-effort: BBB failures never crash discovery.
- `vendor-discovery/data/seed/` (top-level dir) is archival fixture data from an earlier spike — not consumed by the live pipeline.

### Data model (additional tables)

- `vendors` — cache keyed by Google `place_id`. Holds Google fields (display_name, rating, review count, hours, phone, website, 24/7 flag), BBB fields (grade, accreditation, complaints, years-in-business), and the computed `cumulative_score` + breakdown. Re-fetched only when stale.
- `discovery_runs` — one row per `/discovery/run` invocation. Audit + cost tracking: candidate count, cache hits, API detail calls, BBB scrape count, duration, weight profile (urgency).
- `negotiations` — one row per (work_order × vendor). Holds the per-order subjective rank + breakdown, filter state, and placeholder columns (`messages`, `actions_log`, `status`) that subpart 3 will drive.

### Scoring (`scoring.py`)

Two distinct scores:
- **`cumulative_score`** (objective, on `Vendor`) — Bayesian-adjusted Google rating (45%) + BBB grade (25%) + complaint resolution rate (10%) + tenure (20%). Missing signals drop out and remaining weights renormalize. Stable per vendor across customers.
- **`subjective_rank_score`** (per-order, on `Negotiation`) — blends `cumulative_score` with distance fit, 24/7 availability fit, and budget fit. Weights shift by `WorkOrder.urgency` (emergency leans heavily on distance + 24/7; scheduled leans on cumulative + budget).

### Filters (`filters.py`)

Hard filters applied before ranking: business status != operational, distance > 20mi, hours overlap with `scheduled_for`, `bayes_rating < quality_threshold`. Licensed / insured flags are **not** enforced here — those checks are deferred to subpart 3 (ask the vendor directly).

### Entrypoints

- `POST /discovery/run` — manual trigger (takes `work_order_id`, `refresh` flag). Idempotent within a 24h window per work order.
- `GET /discovery/run/{run_id}` — hydrated view of one run.
- Background invocation from `/intake/confirm` — failures log + swallow (never block intake).

### Conventions (subpart 2)

- Real pipeline on real APIs: no fixtures in the live path
- In-DB vendor cache keeps Places bill flat across repeated discovery runs
- BBB enrichment is best-effort; vendors without BBB profiles still score (cumulative weights renormalize)
- `quality_threshold` is checked against the Bayesian-adjusted rating, not raw Google stars

## Subpart 3 — Vendor contact / auctioning (planned)

Agentic outreach across email / SMS / phone, unified per-engagement thread, kanban command center keyed to an engagement state machine (`prospecting → contacted → quoted → negotiating → dispatched → completed`, with `declined` / `ghosted` off-ramps). LLM-simulated vendor personas auto-respond when messaged. Outreach + UI not yet started, but the DB is already wired:

- `EngagementStatus` enum in `backend/app/enums.py`
- `Negotiation.status` column defaults to `PROSPECTING` at discovery time
- `Negotiation.messages` (JSON) + `Negotiation.actions_log` (JSON) are pre-allocated for subpart 3 to fill in

## Admin DB explorer (`frontend/app/admin/page.tsx`)

Read-only surface for inspecting the pipeline end-to-end during the demo. Lists work orders, cached vendors (with cumulative score breakdowns), discovery runs (with audit counts), and negotiations (joined with vendor display name, showing subjective rank breakdown + filter reasons). Backed by `/admin/*` endpoints in `backend/app/routers/admin.py`. Linked from the intake page header and from the post-submit confirmation.

## Conventions (project-wide)

- Breadth first across all three subparts, then deepen subpart 3
- Real pipelines, real APIs: subpart 2 runs against live Google Places + BBB, not fixtures
- Human-in-the-loop: LLM drafts, human approves before any state-changing action
- One unified thread per engagement across modalities — no per-modality silos in the UI
- Engagement state machine is the central abstraction; UI surfaces it directly
- All datetimes in UTC
